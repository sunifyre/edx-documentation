.. _Differentiated Content Overview:

#######################################################
Offering Different Content to Different Learner Groups
#######################################################

You can design your course so that learners are given different content than
others, based on the group that they belong to. Learners can be grouped either
by cohort, or, if your course has more than one enrollment track, by the
enrollment track that learners join for your course.

This section provides information about offering differentiated content in
your course.

Offering Different Content to Learners in Different Enrollment Tracks
*********************************************************************

If your course has more than one enrollment track, you can designate specific
components as being available to learners in specific tracks. For example, you
might provide the same content to all learners in a section but might give one
exam to learners in the audit track and another exam to learners in the
verified certificate track.

For more information, see :ref:`Enrollment Track Specific Courseware Overview`.

If you have enabled :ref:`cohorts in your course<Cohorts Overview>`, you can use
:ref:`content groups<About Content Groups>` to designate particular components
in your course as visible only to specific groups of learners.

For information about offering different content to learners in different
cohorts, see :ref:`Cohorted Courseware Overview`.
